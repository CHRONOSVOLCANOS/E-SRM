Contents:

  - E-SRM_data_and_codes.zip - This file contains all the data and codes to generate the figures in the manuscript.
    
  - Curretly, I have used the structure is such a way to ensure a smooth review process. Therefore, this folder is organized per figure.
  - MATLAB R2019a codes are only used for figures 7 and 8. Each MATLAB code has detailed instructions for reviewers 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS'.
    
  - I have not included Step_1 and Step_2 codes, as they were not directly used to generate the data for figures. I am happy to provide them if needed.

ALL THE RESULTS WERE RECREATABLE AS OF 10/11/2024.

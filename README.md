This repository contains the data and MATLAB codes for the Expanded SRM (E-SRM),
  developed by Dr. Ninad Bhagwat towards his PhD at Montana Technological University)
  LAST UPDATED: 05/01/2025

Contents:
  - Figures 1-11 - These folders contain all the data and codes to generate the figures in the manuscript.
  - Currently, I have used the structure is such a way to ensure a smooth review process. Therefore, this folder is organized per figure.
  - MATLAB codes are only used for figures 7 and 8. Each MATLAB code has detailed instructions for reviewers 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS'. 
  - I have not included Step_1 and Step_2 codes, as they were not directly used to generate the data for figures. I am happy to provide them if needed.

ALL THE RESULTS WERE RECREATABLE AS OF 10/11/2024.
